## Git  
Git is a **version control system** created by Linus Torvalds. Think of it as a tool that helps you track changes in your code over time, like having unlimited “undo” buttons. Key benefits of Git:

- **Version Control**: Save snapshots of your code at different stages.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without conflicts.

## GitHub  
GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** built on top of Git. It lets you store, share, and manage your Git repositories online, making collaboration even easier. Key features:

- **Remote Storage**: Store your code in the cloud.
- **Social Coding**: Collaborate with others, review code, and contribute to projects.

## How They Work Together 
Git manages your code locally, while GitHub allows you to share it with the world. Together, they make teamwork, tracking, and code sharing effortless—perfect for developers everywhere! 

## Getting Started  
1. **Install Git** on your computer.
2. **Create a GitHub account**.
3. **Initialize Git in your project** and **push it to GitHub**.
